## Summary {#summary}

In recent years computerized tools for verifying and manipulating proofs have become much more mature, and as a result formalized proofs are playing a meaningful role in mathematical innovation and teaching.

This short program consists of four colloquium talks on major aspects of formalization, in terms of both underlying ideas and concrete implementations, together with a series of workshop-style sessions intended to give participants first-hand knowledge using the [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) language, its [mathematical library](https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html) and associated tools.
We aim to provide an introduction to the area for working mathematicians and advanced students in a variety of fields.

Copious quantities of coffee ‚òï and space to code and collaborate will be available.

Workshop and talks will be held in the Department of Mathematics, University of Rome Tor Vergata ([Via della Ricerca Scientifica 1, 00133 Roma](https://osm.org/go/xcXqPCo1?m=)).
