# Summary

Over the last several years computerized tools for verifying and manipulating proofs have become much more mature, and as a result formalized proofs have the potential to play a meaningful role in mathematical innovation and teaching well beyond their traditional role in the foundations of mathematics.

This short program consists of three colloquium talks on major aspects of formalization, in terms of both underlying ideas and concrete implementations, together with a series of workshop-style sessions intended to give participants first-hand knowledge using the Lean language and associated tools.  We hope this will provide an introduction to the area for working mathematicians and advanced students in a variety of fields.

- Duration: 3 days
- Day 1: Intro to Lean; Day 2: Numbers, sets and functions; Day 3: Algebra, topology and analysis.
- 1 colloquium talk every day
- Workshop during the remaining time
