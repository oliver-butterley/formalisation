## Summary {#summary}

In recent years computerized tools for verifying and manipulating proofs have become much more mature, and as a result formalized proofs are playing a meaningful role in mathematical innovation and teaching.

This short program consists of four colloquium talks on major aspects of formalization, in terms of both underlying ideas and concrete implementations, together with a series of workshop-style sessions intended to give participants first-hand knowledge using the [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) language, its [mathematical library](https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html) and associated tools.
We aim to provide an introduction to the area for working mathematicians and advanced students in a variety of fields.

Copious quantities of coffee ‚òï and space to code and collaborate will be available.

Workshop and talks will be held in the Department of Mathematics, University of Rome Tor Vergata ([Via della Ricerca Scientifica 1, 00133 Roma](https://osm.org/go/xcXqPCo1?m=)).

## Practical info {#practical}

The Mathematics department of the University of Rome Tor Vergata is not the easiest place to reach from the city centre. Our advice on public transport is to get to the Anagnina stop of Metro Line A and take the 20 or 500 (Atac) bus from there. They stop at several locations within campus. It's easiest (by far) that you get off at the right stop, the one near the "Macroarea di Scienze Matematiche Fisiche e Naturali (M.F.N.)", which is the building that hosts the Mathematics Department (together with other departments).

Here‚Äôs a [Google map pointer to the building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QXFjbkdeqgHf63jY7), that you can use to plan your trip, identify the right stop once you‚Äôre on the bus, etc.

See also [here](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/dovesiamo2.php) for more transportation.

Additionally, I will address the challenges encountered in teaching with Lean and the implications for learning and comprehension.",
